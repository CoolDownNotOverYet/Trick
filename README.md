# Trick  
## it's a project for 2022 ciga game jam, my first time both for a game jam and collabrating with other people.  
## How to play: use WASD or arrow keys to move.Right mouse key to shoot/attack.  
## How to win: It's a puzzle game, at least we were aiming for a meta puzzle-solving game. So, good luck having fun.  
### About: Due to some reason, this project is so different from what we had expected. The gameplay, the narrative, the animation and many other things, but the other two team members and i we were not mad or anything, we took this opportunity as a chance to take a good look at ourselves, and it does(hit us in the face). Anyway, life goes on, so does the development, of game(not this ugly one) and ourselves. One thing for sure is  that we are gonna do better next time, maybe not together as a team, but you got me, right?
